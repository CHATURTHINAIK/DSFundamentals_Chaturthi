I didn't enjoy the film at all; the plot was slow and predictable. I'm not happy with the service provided; the staff was unhelpful. The food was cold and lacked flavor, really not worth the price. I wouldn’t recommend this laptop; it crashes frequently and is too slow. The event was poorly organized, and I didn’t have a good time.
